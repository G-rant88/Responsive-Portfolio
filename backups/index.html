	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<hr>
	<img  id="pic" src="assets/images/benwebsite-1.jpg" alt="Ben Grant">
	<p id="pone">I’m first and foremost an explorer, an explorer of new ideas, styles, culture, art, places, people, and amazing experiences. I love doing photography and video, wherever I go, especially when traveling, and have been lucky enough to see so many incredible sights around the world, and photographed them in my own unique style. I’m a lifestyle and travel photographer for fun, as a hobby, and professionally, with a travel blog and instagram that I frequently update. My passion is capturing life, and I do so in the way that I can, whenever I can, wherever I go.</p>
	
	<p>I have many years of experience with photography and video, and have worked on projects filming, producing, directing, editing, and doing photography from everything to TV shows, commercials, documentaries, DVDs, reality shows, pilots, talk shows, live productions, portraits, events, headshots, weddings, product pictures, and more. I have over 7 years of professional experience and have worked with many great photographers and videographers that I constantly collaborate with in my work. I keep up the best technical and creative knowledge and equipment possible to keep my work at the highest professional standards.</p>
