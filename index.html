	<img  id="pic" src="assets/images/benwebsite-1.jpg" alt="Ben Grant">
	<p id="pone">I’m first and foremost an explorer: an explorer of new ideas, styles, culture, art, places, people, and amazing experiences. I love doing photography wherever I go, especially when traveling, and have been lucky enough to see so many incredible sights around the world, and photographed them in my own unique style. I’m a lifestyle and travel photographer for fun, as a hobby, and professionally, with a travel blog and instagram that I frequently update. My passion is capturing life, and I do so in the way that I can, whenever I can, wherever I go.</p>
	
	<p>I'm also a full stack web developer! As a recent graduate of the UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp, I am fully prepared for everything and anything that has to do with coding. I really enjoy HTML and CSS, and I continue to grow my porfolio each and every day. I'm a hard-working, quick-learning, and passionate web developer, ready to face any and all challenges that are foolish enough to face me.</p>
